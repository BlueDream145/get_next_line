# get_next_line
Epitech Project, get_next_line

Subject:

The goal of this project is to write a function that returns a read line from a file descriptor.
If there are no more lines to return, or if there is an error during the reading, the function will come back
NULL.
You must define a macro called READ_SIZE in your get_next_line.h file, which indicates the amount of
characters to be read for each read() call.
